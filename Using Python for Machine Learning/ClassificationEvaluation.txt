J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}

checks the union between the predicteed and actual labels


Can use F1-Score, matrix score to see the number of FP,TP, etc.
Precision = TP/TP+FP
Recall = TP/(TP + FN)
F1 Score = 2x(prcxrec)/(prc+rec)
higher the better


Log Loss
performance classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1
